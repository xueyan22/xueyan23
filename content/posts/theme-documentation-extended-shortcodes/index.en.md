## 1 Abstract

The number of people with depression around the world is increasing dramatically. Due to the role that online health information plays in depressive people’s treatment, health information-seeking of people suffering from depression has become a vital issue. This study explores the motivation of online health information-seeking among depressed people to explain behaviors further. A qualitative method was designed in this study; semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis were conducted with participants (n=21) suffering from depression self-reportedly. 

### 1.1 Results 

{{< admonition tip "Findings " >}}
Results provide five motivations, reflecting causes of online health information-seeking behaviors: (1)React to abnormal physical appearance; (2)Assess oneself; (3)Obtain support; (4)Manage impression; (5)Avoid negative information. The study concludes a basic motivation model that motivates online health information seeking among depressed people, improving understanding of the behaviors. This model can broaden research on depression people and others with mental disorders.

A direction that makes online information platforms friendly is also proposed in the study. To sum up, the finding of this study offers some significant contributions to theoretical and realistic progress.

## 2 Method

The semi-structured individual interviews that last 30-60 minutes were conducted informally over the telephone or online chatting platform to collect qualitative materials. A significant advantage of the individual interview is that the willingness of participants’ expression increases. Before beginning the interview, researchers briefly introduced the research purpose and related terminology to make participants more engaging.

## 4 Conclusion

**This study set out to explore influencing factors and the mechanism of information sharing intention under risk conditions with suddenness and regularity in mainland China.** News frames, the information feature, were included in the research to compare the possible differences they cause. After analyzing the data from 780 respondents in two groups, we found that reassurance and action frames had no impact on the mechanism of information sharing intention. This suggests that the role of news frames was not as significant as expected due to individual long-term risk exposure and habitual prevention. Outcome expectations and habit affected public and private information sharing intention while habit played a mediating role between outcome expectations and sharing intention. It was shown that both conscious cognitive factors and unconscious factors such as habit impact individual behavioral intention. There are two systems behind information sharing intention. 

In addition, **the repeated cognitive process system can contribute to the formation of stable habits.** The latter refers to a heuristic path. These findings suggest that the regularization of emergencies should be taken into consideration in risk communication among people who don’t have direct high-risk experience. A change of individual information behaviors brought by risks can be preserved as a habit, which deserves further exploration to better manage risk. More importantly, these findings demonstrate influencing factors and mechanisms in public and private information sharing. **Private information sharing can be seen as a part of online risk incubation, which complements public information sharing.** By classifying information sharing, this study expands the understanding of risk information flow.

{{< admonition tip "Implication" >}}
We encourage future research in **three directions**. 
First, it is necessary to **measure individual information sharing behaviors** to explain the process more precisely, which can provide more robust evidence for this model. 
Second, as mentioned earlier, **two news frames in this study had no significant impact on information sharing mechanism**. However, the effect of news frames cannot be ignored in risk communication, so this needs more research in the different phases of risk situations. 
Finally, further research should examine the application possibilities of the information sharing intention model in classified risk situations and **diversified groups**.
