## 1 Abstract

Smart devices are emerging objects with computing capacity and sensing function, which play a vital role in the intelligent society. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of smart devices. This study uses the literature research method to discuss related researches on the usage of smart devices. 

The results show the overview of smart devices and some research issues, **focusing on the three key themes: usage behavior, usage motivation, and influence to present the current state of user researches**. The main challenges in this field are identified as the digital divide, digital assets & privacy protection, development challenges of human survival. Finally, some broader perspectives from future tendencies are explored.


## 2 Conclusion

This paper set out to review the literature on smart devices usage, which is becoming a vital topic that is highly correlated to human survival. This study's results indicate that the state and issues of research on the usage of smart devices. To conclude, three essential conclusions of the research on the use of smart devices are stated: 

first, the age of smart device users is getting lower and lower, **the use scenarios are diverse**, and the popularity level is continuously improving; 
Secondly, the research on the use motivation of smart devices is based on the classical technical model, **which covers the whole use process**. 
Third, the impact of smart devices is reflected at both the micro and macro levels. Despite the convenience they bring to humankind, problems such as the **digital divide** still need to be solved.

{{< admonition tip "Implications" >}}
In summary, research on smart devices' usage is quite broad, and several challenges lay ahead. Researches are concentrating more on the relationship between smart devices and human survival. This article explores the research issues briefly to provide researchers a broader perspective. This study is beyond the scope to examine the extensive influence on the usage of smart devices. So the limitation of this study is that review on the social influence and interdisciplinary application is not enough. <u>Due to the scale of literacy, this study lacks representative to some degree. Further studies need to be carried out in order to adapt to the pace of smart device updates.</u>
